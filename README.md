# LifeLocker

## Description
LifeLocker is a comprehensive web application for personal productivity and data management. It aims to enhance learning, organization, and security in daily life. The application features interactive flashcards for learning, a digital recipe book, a personal journal, and a secure password manager. It employs a robust server-client architecture, prioritizing security and efficiency.

## Key Features

1. **Flashcard Sets**: Users can create and manage interactive flashcard sets, aiding in effective learning and memory retention.

2. **Digital Recipe Book**: A module for organizing and storing favorite recipes, with easy access and editing features.

3. **Personal Journal**: A digital platform for daily reflections, notes, and thoughts, with an intuitive interface.

4. **Password Manager**: A secure system for managing and storing passwords, utilizing advanced encryption techniques.

## System Architecture

### Server-Side
- **Application Server**: Python with Django, featuring Djangoâ€™s security measures against CSRF, SQL Injection, and XSS attacks. Configurations include middleware settings, database connections, and URL routing.
- **Database Server**: PostgreSQL, with a detailed schema for flashcards, recipes, journal entries, and passwords. Utilizes indexes, views, and stored procedures for enhanced performance and security.
- **Security**: Secure connection to the database, and management of credentials.

### Client-Side
- **Technologies**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript for a dynamic UI. CSS3 for responsive design through media queries and flexible layouts.
- **Frameworks**: Choice between React or Vue.js for a single-page application, focusing on component structure, state management, and routing.
- **Responsive Design**: Wireframes illustrate design principles for various devices. Utilization of Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for responsive UI.

### Hosting
- **Local Hosting**: Raspberry Pi for local hosting, discussing setup, OS installation, server configuration, and network configuration.
- **Production Hosting**: Cloud hosting comparison (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) with a focus on deployment processes.

## Networking and Accessibility
- **Remote Access**: Secure access methods, including VPNs, firewall configurations, and network security.
- **Network Security**: Implementation of SSL/TLS, certificate management, and network-level security measures.

## Data Management and Storage
- **Database Design**: An entity-relationship diagram (ERD) for the database schema, discussion on normalization strategies.
- **Data Backup**: Backup strategy including frequency, tools used, disaster recovery plans, and data restoration processes.

## Security Plan
- **Data Encryption**: AES for data at rest, TLS for data in transit, and key management policies.
- **Authentication**: Password-based authentication, two-factor authentication, and OAuth integration.
- **Server Security**: Specific measures for Raspberry Pi security in production, and cloud-native security features.

## User Interface and Experience
- **Design Philosophy**: Pastel color scheme, intuitive layouts, focusing on user-friendliness and accessibility.
- **Wireframes**: Detailed wireframes for each major screen, layout, navigation, and key UI elements.
- **User Flow**: Description of user interaction flows, minimal-click philosophy in UI design.

## Development and Deployment

### Methodology
- **Waterfall Model**: With a structured and sequential approach, each phase is given adequate time for development, testing, and refinement.

### Version Control
- **Git**: Employed for version control with an emphasis on branching strategies, commit conventions, and code reviews.

### Deployment Strategy
- Detailed instructions for deploying the application on Raspberry Pi or cloud environments, with strategies for a smooth deployment and rollback plans.
